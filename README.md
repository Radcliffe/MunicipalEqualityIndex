# Municipal Equality Index

The Municipal Equality Index (MEI) is an annual report published by the
Human Rights Campaign Foundation. From the website:

> The Municipal Equality Index (MEI) examines how inclusive municipal laws,
> policies, and services are of LGBTQ people who live and work there.
> Cities are rated based on non-discrimination laws, the municipality as
> an employer, municipal services, law enforcement and the city leadership's
> public position on equality.

> The 2018 MEI is the seventh annual edition and rates a total of 506 cities
> on 49 different criteria from every state in the nation.

This repo contains data from the Municipal Equality Index for 2013 and 2018,
as well as Python scripts to obtain this data from the HRC website.

Since the data is included in the repository, it is not necessary to run
the Python scripts, except to verify the accuracy of the data. Please avoid
running the scripts unnecessarily, because they generate excess traffic on
the HRC website. Due to changes in the website, the 2013 script no longer
operates correctly, and the 2018 script will also stop working in the future.
